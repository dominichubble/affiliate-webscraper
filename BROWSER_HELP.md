# Browser Opening Solutions

If your browser doesn't open automatically when you run the application, try these solutions in order:

## âœ… **Recommended Solution: Use START_HERE.bat**
- **Double-click `START_HERE.bat`** 
- This uses a Python script that forcefully opens the browser
- Most reliable method across different Windows versions

## ðŸ”„ **Alternative Solutions**

### Option 1: Use the PowerShell Script
- **Right-click `start_ui.ps1`** â†’ "Run with PowerShell"
- PowerShell is often more reliable than batch files

### Option 2: Use the Updated Batch File
- **Double-click `start_ui.bat`**
- This has been updated to explicitly open the browser

### Option 3: Manual Browser Opening
1. Run any of the startup scripts above
2. Wait for the message "Starting web interface..."
3. **Manually open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:8501`

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting Browser Issues**

### If no browser opens automatically:
1. **Check Windows Firewall** - Make sure it's not blocking the connection
2. **Try a different browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Edge all work
3. **Check port availability** - Make sure port 8501 isn't used by another application
4. **Run as Administrator** - Right-click the .bat file â†’ "Run as administrator"

### If browser opens but shows an error:
1. **Wait a moment** - Sometimes the server takes a few seconds to start
2. **Refresh the page** - Press F5 or Ctrl+R
3. **Check the console window** - Look for error messages

### If still having issues:
1. **Run test_setup.py** - This will verify your installation
2. **Check your Python installation** - Make sure Python is working correctly
3. **Try restarting your computer** - Sometimes helps with port conflicts
